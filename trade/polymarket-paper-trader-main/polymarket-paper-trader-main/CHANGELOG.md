# Changelog

All notable changes to `polymarket-paper-trader` are documented here.

## Unreleased

## [0.1.7] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- skills.sh support — skill discoverable via `npx skills add agent-next/polymarket-paper-trader`
- Market discovery: `get_tags` — list all market categories/tags (cached 5 min)
- Market discovery: `get_markets_by_tag` — filter markets by tag slug
- Market discovery: `get_event` — fetch event details (group of related markets, cached 5 min)
- `cancel_all_orders` — batch cancel all pending limit orders at once
- CLI: `markets tags`, `markets --tag <slug>`, `markets event <slug>`, `orders cancel-all`
- MCP tool count: 26 → 30

### Security
- Add data trust boundaries to SKILL.md — mark Polymarket API data as untrusted, prevent indirect prompt injection via market content
- **CRITICAL**: Block arbitrary code execution via `importlib.import_module` — strategy loading now restricted to allowlisted packages (`examples.*`, `tests.test_benchmark.*`)
- **HIGH**: Prevent path traversal via account parameter — reject `..`, `/`, `\` in account names (MCP + CLI)
- **HIGH**: Harden CI/CD — pin all GitHub Actions to full commit SHAs, add restrictive top-level `permissions:`, pin `clawhub@0.7.0`
- **HIGH**: Bump `setuptools` minimum to `>=78.1.1` (CVE fix)
- **MEDIUM**: Sanitize error messages — hide internal paths from unexpected exceptions
- **MEDIUM**: Cap API result limits (`MAX_RESULTS=100`) to prevent resource exhaustion
- **MEDIUM**: Validate backtest `data_path` against allowed directories
